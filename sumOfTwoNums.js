// Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum.

// 1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
"add two numbers together"

// 2. What are the inputs that go into the problems?
// - ints?
// - floats?
// - what about string for large numbers?

// 3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
// - int? float? string?

// 4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?

// 5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

function sumOfTwoNums(num1, num2) {
    let sum = num1 + num2;
    return sum;
}

console.log(sumOfTwoNums(5, 45));
