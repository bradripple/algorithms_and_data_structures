## How to understand the problem

// 1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?


// 2. What are the inputs that go into the problems?
// Should I account for spaces? Capitalized letters? Numbers? Special characters?


// 3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?


// charCount("aaaa"); // {a:4}
// charCount("hello"); // {h:1, e:1, l:2, o:1}

// "my phone number is 8082389988"
// "Hello Hi"
// charCount("")

// 4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?

// 5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
